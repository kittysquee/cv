Currently working as a freelance software engineer with [tosbourn ltd](https://tosbourn.com) and contracting for Barnardo's, the children's charity, assisting their with digital transformation. My background is in critical care nursing and education.

## Skills

### Team Work

I led a medical simulation project, which taught the principles of crisis resource management (CRM). This term comes from aviation, it was developed as a lot of accidents happen due to failures in communication and use of resource.

I created simulated emergency scenarios. We first gave an introduction to CRM and how we can use it, then we ran the scenario and debriefed using advocacy based inquiry. The purpose of these simulations was not to teach clinical skill but team working and communication skills. My Human Factors training was particularly useful to me with CRM.

### Communication

This is something which is particularly important to me. Over the last twelve years I have developed my significant communication skills.

I am able to have difficult conversations with people and break down complex topics into ones which are easy to understand. I am an empathetic listener and people play a very important part in who I am as a person.

I am always willing to listen to and respond to constructive criticism and feedback.

### Documentation

I have spent the last twelve years documenting my working day and know how important it is. If it isn’t properly documented it’s difficult to track progress. One of my mantras is to make things as easy as possible, good documentation makes life easier for everyone.

### Planning and Organisation

I am able to set targets and schedules and track progress through documentation.

In my previous roles I was in charge of planning and executing work for myself and for my team.

In a high pressure environment organisation is key. Over the years I have learned how to stay organised and focused and see the benefits this can bring to my work.

### Mentorship and Education

I enjoy mentoring and teaching. With confidence I have been able to teach peers, students, and more senior staff members (managers and doctors).

People have told me I am approachable and supportive.

I'm a firm believer in sharing what I know and amongst other things have given talks to peers.

### Flexibility and Adaptability

I've developed these skills from working in a critical care environment where patients can deteriorate suddenly. I am very conscious of resource use and can adapt to thrive with limited resources.

I respond well to changing priorities and am very aware that the needs of business change rapidly.

### Research

I have often had to research and put in place best practice findings. Evidence based practice is key in healthcare as it is in web development.

Best practice is in a continual state of flux and I've always sought to stay up to date.
