no major issues. I have continued to keep the site as up to date as possible to
mitigate security issues.

I have also done work to optimise memory usage and storage. I have also

Back End Developer

December 2017 - June 2019 (1 year 7 months)

London, United Kingdom

I was a contract developer in Barnardo's Digital team, assisting with digital
transformation.

Whilst working for Barnardo's I was the sole Ruby on Rails developer for much
of my time there. I worked with a variety of projects including one dealing with
a contactless mobile payment solution which required me to pick up some
Objective-C.

Whilst I was at Barnardo's I had a great interest in keeping all the applications
which I worked with secure and up to date.

I was required to create prototypes quickly to proof ideas.

I developed an app to obfuscate URLs to outside IPs on their intranet. At the
time of my leaving Barnardo's this app had been used nearly a million times.

I also helped onboard new members of staff.

small bodies of work on the website to continually improve it and provided
hosting services.
